The goal of the Conference is to create a multidisciplinary round
table for an open discussion on numerical modeling nature by using
traditional and emerging computational paradigms. The Conference
will discuss all aspects of numerical computations and modeling from
foundations and philosophy to advanced numerical techniques. New
technological challenges and fundamental ideas from theoretical
computer science, linguistic, logic, set theory, and philosophy will
meet requirements and new fresh applications from physics,
chemistry, biology, and economy.

Researchers from both theoretical and applied sciences are very
welcome to submit their papers and to use this excellent possibility
to exchange ideas with leading scientists from different research
fields. Papers discussing new computational paradigms, relations
with foundations of mathematics, and their impact on natural
sciences are particularly solicited. A special attention will be
also dedicated to numerical optimization and different issues
related to theory and practice of the usage of infinities and
infinitesimals in numerical computations.
