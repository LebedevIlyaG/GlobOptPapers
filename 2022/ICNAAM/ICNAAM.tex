\section{INTRODUCTION}

The problem of designing new engineering objects is inseparably connected with the problem of selecting the best values of item parameters, because the choice of specific values of parameters (with a fixed overall structure) can significantly affect its characteristics.

The global optimization problem \cite{Strongin2000}


\section{NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS}

The calculations were performed on the computer cluster of the Institute for Systems Programming and the UniHub web-lab \cite{UniHub}. The web-lab architecture is based on the cloud computing model where resources (servers, networks, storage systems, applications, etc.) are provided remotely as a set of different-level services with on-demand servicing.
