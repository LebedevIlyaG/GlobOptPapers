\section{Introduction}


%Часть ННГУ - начало

In the complex problems of chemical kinetics, kinetic constants of reactions cannot be found analytically, they can only be found using numerical methods (see, for example, [references]). In this case, the quality criterion (objective function) is set in the form of a certain algorithm, which includes the stage of numerical modeling, which, in turn, makes it compute-intensive. Furthermore, in the inverse problems of chemical kinetics, the objective function can be substantially multiextremal, i.e., having many local extremes along the global one. 

Numerical methods for solving such multiextremal problems (global optimization methods) differ significantly from local optimization methods since they require the study of the entire search domain (see, for example, \cite{PaulaviciusZilinskas2014,Sergeyev2017}). These methods can be divided into two classes: meta-heuristic and deterministic. Metaheuristic algorithms are usually based on simulations of processes occurring in the wild.
Examples of metaheuristic algorithms are simulated annealing, evolution and genetic algorithms, etc. (see, for example, \cite{Battiti2009,Eiben2015}).
These algorithms are included in many software libraries for solving global optimization problems (for example, MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox, Scipy.Optimize, etc.).
Due to the operation speed and low requirements for computing resources (in particular, memory), metaheuristic algorithms have become widespread for solving practical problems. However, the solution to the problem found by such an algorithm is, in general, local and can be located far from the global optimum \cite{Kvasov2018}. 

It is also possible to construct deterministic methods of global search, which are different from brute force algorithms and metaheuristic algorithms. Such methods are associated with the presence and consideration of a priori assumptions about the problem properties. 
One of the natural assumptions about the problem is that changing the values of an objective function is limited by changes of its argument. In this case, the function satisfies the Lipschitz condition, and the problem itself is called the Lipschitz global optimization problem. The central direction of the development of modern methods of Lipschitz optimization is the development of parallel algorithms. It is assumed that the values of the objective function are determined as a result of solving some other task and require a costly computational experiment.


This paper reflects the results of applying parallel methods of Lipschitz optimization developed in [refernces], to the solution of inverse problems of chemical kinetics.  
The main part of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section 2 provides a description of the mathematical model of the chemical reaction under study. Section 3 discusses the standard formulation of the Lipschitz global optimization problem and the algorithm for solving it. It also outlines the issues related to the technical aspects of the implementation of the parallel algorithm. The results of the numerical solution of the inverse problem of chemical kinetics using the developed parallel algorithm are discussed in Section 4. The last section contains the conclusion and plans for future work.

\section{Parallel Algorithm for Solving Global Optimization Problems }\label{Sec_GSA}

\subsection{Statement of the global optimization problem}

As mentioned above, from a mathematical point of view, the inverse problem of chemical kinetics can be considered a Lipschitz global optimization problem. 
In general, the problem of the specified class can be formulated as follows:
\begin{gather}
 \phi^* = \phi(y^\ast)=\min{\left\{\phi(y):y\in D\right\}}, \label{problemN}\\
 D=\left\{y\in R^N: a_i\leq y_i \leq b_i, \;  1\leq i \leq N\right\} \label{D},
\end{gather}
where $a,b \in R^N$ are boundaries of the search domain, and the objective function $\phi(y)$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition
\begin{equation}\label{Lip}
\left|\phi(y_1)-\phi(y_2)\right|\leq L\left\|y_1-y_2\right\|,\; y_1,y_2 \in D.
\end{equation}

The function $\phi(y)$ is assumed to be multiextremal and is given in the form of some computational algorithm. The input of this algorithm is supplied with a parameter vector, and the output is the corresponding value of the function. Such functions are often referred to as ``black-box'' functions. It is also assumed that each calculation of the function value at the search domain point (hereinafter also referred to as trial) is a laborious operation and requires significant computational resources. As noted in the introduction, this statement of the problem fully corresponds to the inverse problem of chemical kinetics.

The Lipschitz condition (\ref{Lip}) can be used to construct estimates of the function global minimum, which can serve as a foundation for designing global optimization algorithms and proving their convergence conditions (see, for example, \cite{Strongin2000}).

One of the main difficulties in solving Lipschitz global optimization problems is the so-called ``curse of dimensionality'' --- the exponential increase in the number of trials required to solve a problem with a given accuracy, accompanied by the increasing dimensionality of the problem. It is possible to smooth this effect while maintaining the accuracy of the solution by constructing significantly uneven coverages of the search domain with trial points.

Known examples of such methods are the non-uniform space covering method \cite{Evtushenko2013}, the simplicial partitions method \cite{PaulaviciusZilinskas2014}, the diagonal partitions method \cite{Sergeyev2017}. These techniques are based on adaptive partitioning of the search domain into a finite number of subdomains at each iteration.
Then the need for further subdivision for a more detailed study of these subdomains is estimated (using the accumulated information about the objective function). 
A fundamentally different approach to solving a multidimensional problem (\ref{problemN}) is its reduction to one or more one-dimensional problems followed by the use of efficient methods of one-dimensional optimization. Such reduction may be accomplished, for example, by a nested optimization scheme \cite{Grishagin2018} or by Peano-Hilbert curves \cite{Barkalov2018}. The latter approach is used in this work.

Using a continuous single-valued mapping (Peano-Hilbert curve) $y(x)$ of the real axis segment $[0,1]$ onto hyperinterval $D$ from (\ref{D}), a multidimensional problem (\ref{problemN}) can be reduced to a one-dimensional one
\[
\phi(y^\ast)=\phi(y(x^\ast))=\min{\left\{\phi(y(x)): x\in[0,1]\right\}}.
\]
It is known \cite{Strongin2000, Sergeyev2013} that the reduced one-dimensional function $\phi(y(x))$ will no longer be Lipschitzian, but will satisfy the H{\"o}lder condition
\[
\left|\phi(y(x_1))-\phi(y(x_2))\right|\leq H\left|x_1-x_2\right|^{1/N},
\]
where the H{\"o}lder constant $H$ is associated with the Lipschitz constant $L$ by the relationship $ H=2 L \sqrt{N+3}$.

Specific methods of numerical construction of this kind of mappings (called evolvents) are discussed in \cite{Strongin2000,Sergeyev2013}.
Here we note that evolvent will approximate the theoretical Peano-Hilbert curve with an accuracy of $2^{-m}$, where $m$ is the parameter that sets the approximation accuracy. Examples of evolvent for different dimensions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Peano}.

\end{minipage}
\caption{Evolvents with $m=4$ and (a) $N=2$, (b) $N=3$.}\label{fig:Peano}
\end{figure}   


Thus, under this approach, the search trial at some point $x^k\in[0,1]$ will include the construction of the image $y^k=y(x^k)$ first, and only then the calculation of the value of the function $ z^k = \phi(y^k)$.
We will call the three values $\{x^k,y ^k,z^k\}$ the trial result.

\subsection{Asynchronous parallel algorithm used to determine the global minimum of a function}

The parallel algorithm used in this study is based on the information and statistical approach to the development of global optimization methods, the theoretical foundations of which are set out in \cite{Strongin2000}. 

We have implemented an asynchronous paralleling scheme of the ``master/worker'' type. The master process performs a global search algorithm, in which the search information is accumulated. Then the Lipschitz constants for the objective function are estimated on its basis, and the points of new trials are calculated and distributed over the work processes. Worker-processes receive points from the master, carry out new trials in them, and send the results of the trials to the master. 

Let us assume that at each iteration, the master-process calculates one point of the new trial and transfers it for testing to the worker-process. At the same time, a trial performed by a worker is a much more labor-intensive operation than selection of a new point by a master, which eliminates the downtime of worker-processes. 
In this case (unlike synchronous parallel algorithms), the total number of trials performed by each worker-process  will depend on the labor intensity of the specific trial and cannot be estimated in advance.

When describing a parallel algorithm, let us assume that there is one process master and $p$ workers. The upper index will indicate the serial number of the trial performed, and the lower index will be used to number the trials in ascending order of the coordinate.
 
The initial iteration is carried out according to a special rule. The master process (let us assume that this is the process No 0) initiates  $p$ parallel trials at $p$ different points of the search domain, two of which are boundary points, and the rest are arbitrary internal points (for example, uniformly distributed). Thus, the initial trials are carried out at the points $\{y(x^1), y(x^2), ...,y(x^p)\}$, where $x^1 = 0$, $x^p = 1$, $x^i\in(0,1), i=2,..., p-1$.

Let us suppose that the master-process has obtained the results of $k$ trials, and at the current time the worker-processes are conducting trials at the points
$\{y(x^{k+1}), y(x^{k+2}), ...,y(x^{k+p})\}$.

Let one of the processes (without limiting the commonality, we can assume that this is the process No 1), at some point in time complete the trial at the point $y(x^{k+1})$.
The remaining processes are at the stage of conducting their trials, i.e. at these points multiple trials have already started, but have not yet been completed.

Then the No 1 process forwards to the master process the trial results, i.e. the three values $\{x^{k+1},y^{k+1},z^{k+1}\}$.
The master saves the results in its information base and selects a new trial point $x^{k+p+1}$ for the process No 1 in accordance with the rules described below.

Step 1. Renumber he point of the set 
\[
X_k = \left\{x^1, x^2,...,x^{k+p} \right\},
\]
which contains all the points at which the trials either have been carried out or are being carried out by the lower index in ascending order, i.e.
\[
0=x_1<x_2<...<x_{x+p}=1.
\]
Step 2. Calculate values
\[
M_1=\max \left\{ \frac{ \left|z_i - z_{i-1} \right|}{(x_i-x_{i-1})^{1/N}} : x_{i-1} \notin I_k, x_i \notin I_k, 2\leq i\leq k+p \right\},
\]
\[
M_2=\max \left\{ \frac{ \left|z_{i+1} - z_{i-1} \right|}{(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1})^{1/N}} : x_i \in I_k, 2\leq i < k+p \right\},
\]
\[
M=\max\{M_1,M_2\},
\]
where $z_i=\phi(y(x_i))$, if $x_i \notin I_k, \; 1\leq i \leq k+p$. The $z_i$ values at $x_i \in I_k$ are undefined because the trials at $x_i \in I_k$ are not yet complete. If the value $M$ is 0, assign $M=1$.

Step 3. For each interval $(x_{i-1},x_i), \; x_{i-1} \notin I_k, x_i \notin I_k, \; 2\leq i\leq k+p$, calculate the value 
\[
R(i)=rM\Delta_i+\frac{(z_i-z_{i-1})^2}{rM\Delta_i}-2(z_i+z_{i-1}),
\]
called the characteristic of this interval. Here $\Delta_i=\left(x_i-x_{i-1}\right)^{1/N}$, and $r>1$ is the reliability parameter of the method.

Step 4. Select the interval $[x_{t-1},x_t]$ with the highest characteristic value, i.e.
\[
R(t) = \max \left\{ R(i): \; x_{i-1} \notin I_k, x_i \notin I_k, \; 2\leq i\leq k+p \right\}.
\]

Step 5. Calculate the point $x^{k+p+1} \in (x_{t-1},x_t)$ according to the formula
\[
x^{k+p+1} = \frac{x_{t}+x_{t-1}}{2} - \mathrm{sign}(z_{t}-z_{t-1})\frac{1}{2r}\left[\frac{\left|z_{t}-z_{t-1}\right|}{M}\right]^N.
\]

Immediately after calculating the point $x^{k+p+1}$ of the next trial, the master-process adds it to the set $I_k$ and forwards it to the worker-process, which initiates the trial at this point. 

The master process terminates the algorithm if either the condition $\Delta_{t}<\varepsilon$ ($t$ is number of the interval with the maximum characteristic from Step 4) or the condition $k>K_{max}$ ($k$ is the number of trials performed) is met.
The real number $\varepsilon>0$ and the integer $K_{max}>0$ are the algorithm parameters which correspond to the accuracy of the solution search and the maximum number of trials.

The sequential global search algorithm, on the basis of which the proposed asynchronous algorithm was implemented, allows the following interpretation \cite{Molinaro2001}. Using the points of previously performed trials, it is possible to construct a minorant of the objective function, for which the value $-R(i)$, where $R(i)$ is the value of the characteristic of the interval $(x_{i-1}, x_i)$, will be the value of the minorant at the point of its minimum at the interval $(x_{i-1},x_i), 1\leq i\leq k+p$. In accordance with Step 4 of the algorithm, a new trial is carried out in the interval with the lowest value of the minorant. And in accordance with Step 5, the point of the new trial coincides with the minorant minimum point.

The theory of convergence and various modifications of serial and parallel algorithms are detailed in the monographs \cite{Strongin2000,Sergeyev2017}. 
It should be noted that the asynchronous parallelization scheme described here, in contrast to the synchronous schemes used earlier in solving a number of application problems (see \cite{Kalyulin2017, Modorskii2016}), provides a full load of all the processes involved in solving problems with different labor intensity of trials at different points in the search domain.


\subsection{Features of the software implementation of the parallel algorithm}

\end{figure}   

In our implementation of the global search algorithm, MPI is used to organize parallel calculations. A process with the rank 0 acts as a master, processes with a rank other than 0 act as calculators (workers), see the description of the algorithm in the previous section.

The principle of process interaction (Figure \ref{fig:Impl}, link 1) is as follows. The first step in the master-process is to select $p$ points for trials. The selected trial points are sent to the calculators and the master enters the stand-by state for receiving messages. Messages from the calculators contain the trial result. The obtained information is used to select the point of the next trial. The new point is sent as a message to the calculator. If the stopping condition is met in the algorithm, instead of the trial point the master sends a shutdown message to the calculator.

Each process that performs the role of a calculator creates an instance of the task when it starts, and then goes into a stand-by mode for messages from the master-process. When a message containing a trial point is received, a computational experiment is performed. The results of the experiment are sent to the master. After the experiment, the process itself continues to wait for new messages. When a shutdown message is received, the resources used by the task are released and the main process is terminated.

When implementing the asynchronous scheme, we assumed that the start time of calculating the objective function values is different for each particular process. Our implementation takes into account the fact that the trial point as well as the calculation results represent a small amount of data that can be sent relatively quickly over the network. As a result, basic point-to-point MPI message forwarding operations were used to interact between the master and the calculators (Figure \ref{fig:Impl}, link 1). 

When conducting computational experiments (see next section), the solution of the direct problem of chemical kinetics was performed using MATLAB. In the initial version of the problem, each set of parameters required starting the MATLAB process, transferring the trial point, as well as obtaining the results of computational experiments. A number of additional settings have been made to reduce computing overhead. First, the source code for the computational experiment was compiled into an executable application. Second, the approach in which MATLAB receives a trial point through input stream, and returns the results of computational experiment through output stream was implemented. This approach allowed each calculator to run a process with compiled MATLAB code once, intercept input and output streams, and then perform calculations without waiting for new processes to start. 

\section{Numerical Experiments}

The asynchronous parallel global search algorithm was implemented on C++; the software was built on Intel MPI and Intel C++ compiler, version 2017.0.1. The objective function of the problem to be solved was implemented in MATLAB 2019b.
In order to check the stability of the developed parallel program, it was launched on three different supercomputers: Lomonosov-2 (Moscow State University), Lobachevsky (University of Nizhni Novgorod), and MVS-10P (Joint Supercomputer Center of the RAS). The main part of the experiments was carried out on the Lomonosov-2 supercomputer with the following computer nodes characteristics: Intel Haswell-EP E5-2697v3 CPU (processor frequency 2.6 GHz, 14 cores), 64 GB of RAM, CentOS 7 operating system.

To solve the optimization problem, a combination of the parallel global search algorithm and a local optimization method was used. In the first stage of the search, the parallel asynchronous algorithm described in Section \ref{Sec_GSA} was used. 101 processes were involved in the launch, of which one process was a master and the remaining 100 were workers (calculators). The values of the method parameters were set as follows: the maximum number of trials $K_{max}=3000$, the search accuracy $\varepsilon=10^{-3}$, the reliability parameter $r=3$, the evolvent accuracy parameter $m=12$. At the second stage, the solution was refined using the pattern search method with an accuracy of $\varepsilon=10^{-4}$ and a limit on the number of trials $K_{max}=500$.
The total time for solving the problem was 8109 seconds, an optimum point was found with the objective function value $\phi^* = 0.002115$.
